Overview
---
This repository contains the final files for the Behavioral Cloning Project.

In this project, I attempted to use what I've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior.  There is a writeup giving full details of the implementation provided here.


The project requires submitting five files: 
* model.py (script used to create and train the model)
* drive.py (script to drive the car - feel free to modify this file)
* model.h5 (a trained Keras model)
* a report writeup file (either markdown or pdf)
* youtube video link provided in writup
